Tasks :
	PC :
		1. Modularisation of the model
		2. 3 different trial types
		3. Attractor behaviors

Deadline :1-2/02/2015


Meeting notes:
	+ Make the model more attractor (could be activity too low)
	+ Urgency looks additive at neuron level, but 
		multiplicative at the behavior level.
	+ Start with multiplicative urgency 
	+ Linear urgency signal from data (depends on trial types)
	+ Using trials from data
	+ Will need to optimize code eventually
	+ Interesting question : how is the linear distance in input maintained
	+ Treshold with difference in activity (PMD)  (perhaps 16 Hz)
	+ 2 regions identical for now
