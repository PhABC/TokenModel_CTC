Meeting notes:
X	+ Make the model more attractor (could be activity too loww
X	+ Urgency looks additive at neuron level, but
		multiplicative at the behavior level.
X	+ Start with multiplicative urgency
	+ Linear urgency signal from data (depends on trial types)
X	+ Using trials from data
	+ Will need to optimize code eventually
	+ Interesting question : how is the linear distance in input maintained
	+ Treshold with difference in activity (PMD)  (perhaps 16 Hz)
	+ 2 regions identical for now
